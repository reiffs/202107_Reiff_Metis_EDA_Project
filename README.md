### **Project Scope**
* **Background:** Proprietary consumer research conducted by one of America's largest wireless telecom operators (ABC Telecom, 'ABC') suggests that a majority of New York commuters are unsatisfied with (free) public Wi-Fi bandwidth in Manhattan, and would be willing to supplement their cellular data plans with a subscription for fixed-access public Wi-Fi for up to $5/month. To address the most severely underserved neighborhoods in Manhattan, ABC is considering analyzing commuter traffic in tandem with current Wi-Fi hotspot density to identify areas of lowest bandwidth/commuter, under the assumption that highest bandwidth demand is during morning/evening commutes and lunch time. Assuming a successful commercial launch to underserved areas within Manhattan, ABC thinks its service can be more widely deloyed throughout New York.    
* **Data & Implementation:** The primary data sets leveraged for this analysis will be **1)** NYC MTA turnstyle data as made available by New York's Metro Transportation Authority (MTA) via free CSV file on the MTA website; and **2)** NYC public Wi-Fi hotspot locations provided by NYC OpenData for free via API. To gain a reasonable understanding of 'normalized' commuter traffic patterns in NYC pre- and post-COVID, this project will require at least 9 months of turnstyle data (Apr-Jul 2021, Apr-Jul 2020, Apr-Jul 2019), though only the most recent cross-sectional data set for Wi-Fi hotspots will be required.   
* **Tool/Technology Requirements:** This project will require ingestion of the MTA turnstyle data into a relational database via python.  
* **Objective(s):** XXXXX
