### **MVP overview**
* **Goal:** This analysis seeks to identify areas of low Wi-Fi hotspot density relative to heavy commuter traffic. In order to assess density/traffic, it is first necessary to identify standalone commuter volumes and hotspot locations.
* **Process:** Data exploration to reach this conclusion entailed aggregation of daily commuter data at the turnstile level, MTA station level, and finally zip code level; Wi-Fi hotspots were aggregated at the zip code level.   
* **Preliminary visualization:** The first two figures below depict the highest and lowest traffic zip codes for MTA commuters aggregated for the latest three months (Apr, May, Jun, Jul '21) and late summer/fall for '18 and '19 (Jul, Aug, Sept); the three highest volume zip codes for commuter traffic in this window are the Chelsea, Tribeca, and Downtown Brooklyn neighborhoods, while the three lowest volume zip codes for commuter traffic in this window are Harlem, Belmont/The Bronx, and Melrose/The Bronx. The second two figures illustrate the highest and lowest density zip codes for public Wi-Fi hotspots; Downtown Brooklyn, Chelsea, and the Upper West Side have the highest hotspot density, while the bottom 20 zip codes only have one hotspot per zip code. 
* **Preliminary conclusions:** At first blush, this suggests there could be opportunity to deploy Wi-Fi hotspots in zip codes similar to **10001** and **10007** as they have some of the highest commuter traffic without a commensurate rank in Wi-Fi hotspot density.
