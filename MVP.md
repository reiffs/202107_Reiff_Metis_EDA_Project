### **MVP overview**
* **Goal:** This analysis seeks to identify areas of low Wi-Fi hotspot density relative to heavy commuter traffic. In order to assess density/traffic, it is first necessary to identify standalone commuter volumes and hotspot locations.
* **Process:** Data exploration to reach this conclusion entailed aggregation of daily commuter data at the turnstile level, MTA station level, and finally zip code level.  
* **Preliminary visualization:** The figures below depict the highest and lowest traffic zip codes for MTA commuters aggregated for the latest three months (Apr, May, Jun, Jul '21) and late summer/fall for '18 and '19 (Jul, Aug, Sept). The three highest volume zip codes for commuter traffic in this window are the Chelsea, Tribeca, and Downtown Brooklyn neighborhoods. The three lowest volume zip codes for commuter traffic in this window are Harlem, Belmont/The Bronx, and Melrose/The Bronx.
